/**
 * The component design pattern is a common game design structure. This pattern is often
 * used to reduce duplication of code as well as to improve maintainability.
 * In this implementation, component design pattern has been used to provide two game
 * objects with varying component interfaces (features). As opposed to copying and
 * pasting same code for the two game objects, the component interfaces allow game
 * objects to inherit these components from the component classes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The implementation has decoupled graphic, physics and input components from
 * the player and NPC objects. As a result, it avoids the creation of monolithic java classes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The below example in this App class demonstrates the use of the component interfaces
 * for separate objects (player &amp; NPC) and updating of these components as per the
 * implementations in GameObject class and the component classes.
