/**
 * Created by robertt240 on 1/26/17.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Guarded-suspension is a concurrent design pattern for handling situation when to execute some
 * action we need condition to be satisfied.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Implementation is based on GuardedQueue, which has two methods: get and put, the condition is
 * that we cannot get from empty queue so when thread attempt to break the condition we invoke
 * Object's wait method on him and when other thread put an element to the queue he notify the
 * waiting one that now he can get from queue.
