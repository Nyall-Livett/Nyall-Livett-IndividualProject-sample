/**
 * The Version Number pattern helps to resolve concurrency conflicts in applications.
 * Usually these conflicts arise in database operations, when multiple clients are trying
 * to update the same record simultaneously.
 * Resolving such conflicts requires determining whether an object has changed.
 * For this reason we need a version number that is incremented with each change
 * to the underlying data, e.g. database. The version number can be used by repositories
 * to check for external changes and to report concurrency issues to the users.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example we show how Alice and Bob will try to update the {@link Book}
 * and save it simultaneously to {@link BookRepository}, which represents a typical database.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;As in real databases, each client operates with copy of the data instead of original data
 * passed by reference, that's why we are using {@link Book} copy-constructor here.
