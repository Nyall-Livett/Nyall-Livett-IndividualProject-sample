package com.iluwatar.intercepting.filter;

/**
 * When a request enters a Web application, it often must pass several entrance tests prior to the
 * main processing stage. For example, - Has the client been authenticated? - Does the client have a
 * valid session? - Is the client's IP address from a trusted network? - Does the request path
 * violate any constraints? - What encoding does the client use to send the data? - Do we support
 * the browser type of the client? Some of these checks are tests, resulting in a yes or no answer
 * that determines whether processing will continue. Other checks manipulate the incoming data
 * stream into a form suitable for processing.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The classic solution consists of a series of conditional checks, with any failed check
 * aborting the request. Nested if/else statements are a standard strategy, but this solution leads
 * to code fragility and a copy-and-paste style of programming, because the flow of the filtering
 * and the action of the filters is compiled into the application.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The key to solving this problem in a flexible and unobtrusive manner is to have a simple
 * mechanism for adding and removing processing components, in which each component completes a
 * specific filtering action. This is the Intercepting Filter pattern in action.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this example we check whether the order request is valid through pre-processing done via
 * {@link Filter}. Each field has its own corresponding {@link Filter}.
