/**
 * FanOut/FanIn pattern is a concurrency pattern that refers to executing multiple instances of the
 * activity function concurrently. The &quot;fan out&quot; part is essentially splitting the data into
 * multiple chunks and then calling the activity function multiple times, passing the chunks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When each chunk has been processed, the &quot;fan in&quot; takes place that aggregates results from each
 * instance of function and forms a single final result.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This pattern is only really useful if you can “chunk” the workload in a meaningful way for
 * splitting up to be processed in parallel.
